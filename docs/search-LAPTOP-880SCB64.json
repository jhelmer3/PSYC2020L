Starting with the penguins dataset, summarize() the data to get the mean and SD for flipper_length_mm by species. Don’t forget about the .by argument for the summarize() function!\nNote: there will be missing values for this dataset. Add the na.rm = TRUE argument to any mean() or SD() function to remove those.\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  summarize(.by = species,\n            flipper_length_mean = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T),\n            flipper_length_sd = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  species   flipper_length_mean flipper_length_sd\n  &lt;fct&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie                   190.              6.54\n2 Gentoo                   217.              6.48\n3 Chinstrap                196.              7.13\n\n\n\n\n6b) Discuss these findings (1–2 sentences).\nThe Gentoo penguins have the highest mean flipper length, but interestingly have the lowest SD! The Adelie penguins have the lowest mean flipper length. Or something like that. \n\n\n7a) Now let’s move on to 2: Identify the minimum and maximum bill length-to-depth ratio for female penguins on the Biscoe island by year. In one pipe, do the following things:\n\nCalculate the bill length-to-depth ratio by adding a column that divides bill_length_mm by bill_depth_mm.\nNarrow down the data to the desired penguins by filtering such that only female penguins on the Biscoe island remain.\nSummarize the data with two values: the minimum bill length-to-depth ratio and the maximum bill length-to-depth ratio. Do this by the year the measurement was collected.\n\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  mutate(bill_ltd = bill_length_mm / bill_depth_mm) |&gt;\n  filter(sex == \"female\" & island == \"Torgersen\") |&gt;\n  summarize(.by = year,\n            bill_ltd_min = min(bill_ltd),\n            bill_ltd_max = max(bill_ltd))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n   year bill_ltd_min bill_ltd_max\n  &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2007         1.87         2.34\n2  2008         1.76         2.43\n3  2009         2.1          2.36\n\n\n\n\n7b) Discuss these findings (1–2 sentences).\nThe lowest minimum bill length-to-depth ratio for female penguins on the Biscoe island was collected in 2008. The highest maximum bill length-to-depth ratio for female penguins on the Biscoe island was also collected in 2008—that year had the largest range!\n\n\n8a) Come up with your own question to answer about this dataset! As info, this question will need to include at least two functions’ worth of tidyverse piping (i.e., data |&gt; function1() |&gt; function2()). First, just write your question below.\nHow does the mean of body_mass_g for female penguins vary over species and island?\n\n\n8b) Next, write the code that addresses your question.\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(sex == \"female\") |&gt;\n  summarize(.by = c(species, island),\n            body_mass_mean = mean(body_mass_g))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  species   island    body_mass_mean\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    Torgersen          3396.\n2 Adelie    Biscoe             3369.\n3 Adelie    Dream              3344.\n4 Gentoo    Biscoe             4680.\n5 Chinstrap Dream              3527.\n\n\n\n\n8c) Lastly, please discuss these findings (1–2 sentences).\nSome description that addresses their question and matches the findings."

Do we need to modify the aesthetic or the geom, and how do you know?\nGeom. We want to add a new layer of information to our plot, so we modify the geom.\n\n\n9h) Add the trend lines!

    "text": "Exploration\n\n4a) Let’s continue exploring the relationships influencing a diamond’s price. Let’s start by building on what we saw about the relationship between a diamond’s quality (cut) and its price. With cut on the x-axis and price on the y-axis, make a violin and boxplot graph.\n\n\n4b) Make three modifications to this visualization that you think improve it. Describe your reasoning for each modification.\n\n\n4b) Box and violinplots are helpful, but it is also often helpful to see the datapoints themselves. The geom_jitter() function will add the points correctly to where they lie on the y-axis, but a bit scattered around the x-axis (because the x-axis is not numeric). Add this geom (you may also want to decrease the alpha value).\n\n\n4d) What relationship(s) do we see in this plot?\n\n\n4e) Say we wanted to zoom in on the distributions of the lower-priced diamonds. Make two different plots: one that zooms in with coord_cartesian(), and one that zooms in with ggplot2’s ylim(). What is the difference, and which one do you think is generally best practice to use? Feel free to check the ?ylim documentation.\n\n\n5a) Let’s step back and explore the distributions of the price variable with histograms. Make two versions: one with 10 bins and one with 50 bins. What do you notice about this plot?\n\n\n5b) Swap the histogram to a geom_density() plot. Also, map the density plot line color to the cut of the diamond.\n\n\n5c) Make three modifications to the density plot that you think improve it. Describe your reasoning for each modification.\n\n\n5d) Describe what you see in the plot now. Does this explain anything you noticed in 5a?\n\n\n6a) Perhaps the relationship between diamond quality (cut) and price has to do with its size. Let’s first look at the relationship between price and size, and then we will see if it can explain the price. To do this, create a cleaner version of the diamonds dataset in one pipe that:\n\nHas x, y, and z each in their own row for each diamond,\nUses mutate() to change diamond sizes at 0mm or above 20mm to NA (based on what we saw in class), and\nChanges the x, y, and z variables to be a factor with labels indicating the dimension they measure (feel free to reference ?diamonds for data information and ?factor for factor syntax).\n\n\n\n6b) Now, let’s look at the relationship between diamond size and quality. Using your cleaned dataframe, start by making a histogram with the size measurement on the x-axis. Change the default number of bins to a better one (in your opinion).\n\n\n6c) Use the facet_wrap() function to facet the histogram by the type of measurement. You can use the scales = \"free_x\" argument to let the x-axis scales automatically generate for each facet (as opposed to them all sharing the same).\n\n\n6d) Let’s add in the diamond quality (cut) as the fill color. Also, change the position argument to \"fill\" to best see the proportions.\n\n\n6e) What do you see in this plot? (1–3 sentences)\n\n\n7a) Let’s bring it all together by looking at size, cut, and price all in the same visualization. Still using your cleaned version of the dataset, make a scatterplot with the size measurement on the x-axis, the price on the y-axis, and color denoting the cut. Use the facet_wrap() function again to facet by the type of measurement. You may want to take down the alpha value of the points!\n\n\n7b) Describe what you see in this plot.
