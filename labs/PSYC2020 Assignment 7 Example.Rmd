## Goals for Review:

* Exploratory Data Analysis

For each question, please make sure you include code output. If the question asks for comparison or further explanation, please make sure to include that as well. 


## Setting Up

### 1) Rename this assignment as "Lab 7 Assignment [Last, First].Rmd" 

### 2) Check and set (if needed) your working directory. If you'd like to load packages with `library()`, please do so in this block. Make sure to load the `tidyverse` package!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
here::here()
```
