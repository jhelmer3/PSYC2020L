## Assignment 4 Review

### RMarkdown and Working Directories

We won't have to worry about this today, but some things we can try:

:::: {.columns style="font-size:75%"}
::: {.column width=33%}
Make sure your .Rmd assignment file is in the same folder as your .Rproj file

Default directory for code chunks is folder that contains .rmd document
:::

::: {.column width=33%}
If .Rmd file is in the same folder as your .Rproj file and `getwd()` returns a different directory than your project folder, we can try

```{r, eval=F}
#| code-line-numbers: false
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '/tmp')
```
or

```{r, eval=F}
#| code-line-numbers: false
here::i_am("any_project_subfolders/assignment.Rmd")
```

## Whole Game

Pieces of the "whole game" of data science

![](tidyflow.png)


## Whole Game

Today's plan:

* Introduce each of these principles

* Learn about `tidyverse` syntax

* Cover some examples of `tidyverse` functions that fall into each category

* Conduct our first "full analysis" by following the tidy workflow


# Whole Game

**Import** <span style="color: #C5C5C5;">→ Tidy → Transform → Visualize → Model → Communicate</span>


## Import

Bringing our data into R

We've done this with the `read()` function family and / or the `rio` package

...Neither of those are `tidyverse` packages

But that's fine! This step is the simplest


## Import: Today's dataset

Dataset on pulse rates before and after exercise

Can import from the internet

```{r}
pulse_data <- rio::import("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ms212.txt") 
```

Or download the .rds file from Canvas

```{r, warning=F}
pulse_data <- rio::import(here::here("labs", "Lab 5 - Intermediate R", "pulserates.rds"))
```

.rds is a file extension for R objects


## Import: Today's dataset

<div style="font-size:75%">
| Variable | Description|
|------|------------------------------------------|
|	Height |	Height (cm) |
|	Weight |	Weight (kg) |
|	Age |	Age (years) |
|	Gender |	Sex (1 = male, 2 = female) |
|	Smokes |	Regular smoker? (1 = yes, 2 = no) |
|	Alcohol	|	Regular drinker? (1 = yes, 2 = no) |
|	Exercise |	Frequency of exercise (1 = high, 2 = moderate, 3 = low) |
|	Ran 	|	Whether the student ran or sat between the measurements (1 = ran, 2 = sat) |
|	Pulse1	|	First pulse measurement (rate per minute) |
|	Pulse2 	|	Second pulse measurement (rate per minute) |
|	Year 	|	Year of class (93--98) |
</div>


## Import: Today's dataset

Let's check out our data

```{r, include=F}
summary(pulse_data)
str(pulse_data)
head(pulse_data)
```

```{webr}
# let's look at our data!

# summary(), str(), head()
# psych::describe()
```



# Whole Game

<span style="color: #C5C5C5;">Import → </span>**Tidy**<span style="color: #C5C5C5;"> → Transform → Visualize → Model → Communicate</span>


## Tidy

Refers to *tidy data*

::: {style="font-size:75%;"}
> "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."\
> --- Leo Tolstoy

> "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way."\
> --- Hadley Wickham
:::

Tidy data follow a consistent set of organizational principles

More work up front but **much** easier to work with after


## Tidy

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=32%}
```{r, echo=F}
pulse_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(PersonId = dplyr::row_number()) |>
  dplyr::select(PersonId, Height, Weight, Year) |>
  head()
```
:::

::: {.column width=2%}
<!-- spacing -->
:::

::: {.column .fragment .fade-out width=32% data-fragment-index="1"}
```{r, echo=F}
pulse_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(PersonId = dplyr::row_number()) |>
  dplyr::select(PersonId, Height, Weight, Year) |>
  tidyr::pivot_longer(c("Height", "Weight"),
               names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Value") |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  head()
```
:::

::: {.column width=2%}
<!-- spacing -->
:::

::: {.column .fragment .fade-out width=32% data-fragment-index="1"}
```{r, echo=F}
pulse_data |>
  dplyr::mutate(PersonId = dplyr::row_number(),
         HeightToWeight = paste0(Height, "/", Weight)) |>
  dplyr::select(PersonId, HeightToWeight, Year) |>
  head()
```
:::
::::

All of these dataframes contain the same information, but one of them is much easier to work with...

::: fragment
Why?
:::


## Tidy: Principles

Three rules to a tidy dataset

1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.

2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.

3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/images/tidy-1.png)

<https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#fig-tidy-structure>
:::


## Tidy: Why tidy?

1. Consistency! Any sort of consistency in your data management will be beneficial.

::: fragment
What's often the primary argument of functions we've used?
:::

::: fragment
2. R loves vectors! Having variables in columns plays well with many functions
:::


## Tidy: Is our data tidy?

:::: {.columns style="font-size:75%"}
::: {.column width=70%}
```{r}
head(pulse_data, n = 10)
```
:::

::: {.column width=30%}
1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.

2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.

3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.
:::
::::


## Tidy: For later...

We will learn ways to make untidy data tidy in later classes

For now, we are good, and can proceed with our analysis!



# Whole Game

<span style="color: #C5C5C5;">Import → Tidy → </span>**Transform**<span style="color: #C5C5C5;"> → Visualize → Model → Communicate</span>


## Transform

Usually, our data doesn't come to us with the variables exactly as we want them

Sometimes we need...

* New variables, based on our existing data or otherwise

* Summarized version of our dataset

* Reordered variables

* Etc., etc., etc. Any others?


## Transform: `tidyverse` syntax 

The `tidyverse` website mentioned that each package shares a common language for their functions

Based off of `dplyr` (one of the packages) verbs

1. The first argument is always a data frame.

2. The subsequent arguments typically describe which columns to operate on using the variable names (without quotes).

3. The output is always a new data frame.

::: footer
<https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#dplyr-basics>
:::


## Transform: Load the `tidyverse`

Let's get ready to actually use some `tidyverse` code!

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r, message=T}
library(tidyverse)
```

::: {.callout-note}
Note the `Conflicts` section! Remember when we talked about overwriting?
:::


## Transform: More `tidyverse` syntax 

One more thing...

`tidyverse` verbs work best in a **pipe**: |>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
How we've been using functions:

`output <- function(input)`
:::

::: {.column}
Functions in a pipe:

`output <- input |> function()`
:::
::::

Why is this helpful?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column .fragment}
Many functions together:

```
anotherfunction(otherfunction(function(input)))
```
:::

::: {.column .fragment}
Functions in a pipe:

```
input |>
  function() |>
  otherfunction() |>
  another function()
```
:::
::::


## Transform: Goals for our data

In what ways should we transform our data?

First, we need to figure out our questions!


## Transform: Goals for our data

<div style="font-size:75%">
| Variable | Description|
|------|------------------------------------------|
|	Height |	Height (cm) |
|	Weight |	Weight (kg) |
|	Age |	Age (years) |
|	Gender |	Sex (1 = male, 2 = female) |
|	Smokes |	Regular smoker? (1 = yes, 2 = no) |
|	Alcohol	|	Regular drinker? (1 = yes, 2 = no) |
|	Exercise |	Frequency of exercise (1 = high, 2 = moderate, 3 = low) |
|	Ran 	|	Whether the student ran or sat between the measurements (1 = ran, 2 = sat) |
|	Pulse1	|	First pulse measurement (rate per minute) |
|	Pulse2 	|	Second pulse measurement (rate per minute) |
|	Year 	|	Year of class (93--98) |
</div>


## Transform: Goals for our data

My questions: 

1. Is the difference in pulse between the first and second measurement points different for people who ran or not?

2. Does that difference vary by whether or not someone is a regular smoker?

3. What is the relationship between first and second pulse measurements? Does this differ by smoking status?

4. Class question!! (time pending)


## Transform: Gameplan

Transformation goals:

1. Make a variable with the difference between the first and second pulse measurement points

2. Code some of our numeric variables into their categories

3. Subset our data to only include the relevant columns

4. Summarize information based on our questions


## Transform: Factor Variables

New data type (to us): **factor** variable

How R works with categorical data

Sets fixed possibilities of values that the variable can take on 

If you have a variable with days of the week...

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
```{r}
days <- c("Tues", "Wed", "Thurs")
```

Nothing preventing typos and no sensible sorting
```{r}
moredays <- c("Teus", "Wed", "Thrus")
sort(days)
```
:::

::: {.column .fragment}
Factors help with both. Start by creating a vector of *levels*
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: false
weekday_levels <- c("Mon", "Tues", "Wed", "Thurs", "Fri")
```

And now make a factor
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: false
days_fct <- factor(days, levels = weekday_levels)
```
:::
::::


## Transform: Factor Variables

Will convert to `NA` if not valid level
```{r}
factor(moredays, levels = weekday_levels)
```
Better sorting
```{r}
sort(days_fct)
```


## Transform: Some relevant functions

<div style="font-size:60%">
|   |   |
|---|---|
| `mutate()` | adds, changes, renames columns |
| `factor()` | converts numeric to factor data type |
| `select()` | selects specified columns |
| `filter()` | selects specified rows |
| `summarize()` | summarizes data |
</div>

Switching to RStudio...


## Transform: Sample code

#### Goal 1, 2, and 3: 

1. Make a variable with the difference between the first and second pulse measurement points

2. Code some of our numeric variables into their categories

3. Subset our data to only include the relevant columns
```{r}
pulse_subset <- pulse_data |>
  mutate(PulseDiff = Pulse2 - Pulse1,
         Smokes = factor(Smokes, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Yes", "No")),
         Ran = factor(Ran, levels = c(1, 2), labels = c("Ran", "Sat"))) |>
  select(Smokes, Ran, Pulse1, Pulse2, PulseDiff)
```


## Transform: Sample code

#### Goal 4:

4. Summarize information based on our questions
```{r}
pulse_subset |>
  summarize(.by = Ran,
            PulseDiffMean = mean(PulseDiff, na.rm=T))

pulse_subset |>
  summarize(.by = c(Ran, Smokes),
            PulseDiffMean = mean(PulseDiff, na.rm=T))
```

## Visualize

So many numbers! Can we please visualize our data?

::: {style="font-size:75%;"}
> “The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” — John Tukey
:::

Yes! With the `ggplot2` package

A bit of a different plotting system than we've done before

But much more expansive and flexible (and much nicer looking, if you ask me!)


## Visualize: `ggplot2`

Let's briefly explore a different question: what is the relationship between the pulse measurements at the two different time points?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=66%}
```{r, echo=F}
pulse_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Pulse1, y = Pulse2, color = Ran, fill = Ran)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.4) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(40, 180), ylim = c(40, 180)) +
  labs(x = "First Pulse", y = "Second Pulse") +
  facet_wrap(~ Smokes, labeller = "label_both") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        aspect.ratio = 1)

Next, we want to tell `ggplot()` what information we want in our plot and where we want it

We do this with the `aes()` ("aesthetics") function in the `mapping =` argument

How variables are *mapped* onto specific parts of the plot

To investigate the relationship between the first and second pulse measurements, we can choose to put `Pulse1` on the x-axis and `Pulse2` on the y-axis

What do we get?

These variables are conceptually similar and should probably have the same scale

Automatically generated axes are a good place to start

Let's say we want to look at this for smokers vs non-smokers

What can we tell from this?

## Model

At this point, we could take the statistical models we know and apply them to the data

We haven't learned many yet, but we have learned some!

`mean()`, `sd()` could combine to model the distribution of your data, etc.

We will do more modeling later!



# Whole Game

## Communicate

We...have already learned ways to do this with RMarkdown!

Statistics and visualizations are great, but to tell a good story it is often useful to accompany these with text explaining the key features or importance.

And we've been practicing this all along by describing the plots!


## Communicate: Pulse Measurements

:::: {.columns style="font-size:70%"}
::: {.column width=60%}
```{r, echo=F}
pulse_subset |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Pulse1, y = Pulse2, color = Ran, fill = Ran)) +
  geom_point(size = 2.4) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(40, 180), ylim = c(40, 180)) +
  labs(x = "First Pulse", y = "Second Pulse") +
  facet_wrap(~ Smokes, labeller = "label_both") +
  theme_classic(base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        aspect.ratio = 1)
```

In this visualization, we can see a strong positive relationship between participants' pulse measurements at the first time point and their pulse measurements at the second time point. We can see that the individuals who ran in between the measurements had similar values on the x-axis (the first measurement) but much higher values at the second measurement. While it seems like there may be some differences in pulse between regular smokers and non-smokers, there is much fewer observations present for non-smokers.
