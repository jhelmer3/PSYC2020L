## Assignment 10 Review

Great work!


## *T*-Statistic Cutoffs

Say you want to find the cutoff *t* values: $t(\text{df}=3)$ and $t(\text{df}=37)$ for $\alpha = .05$, both upper one-tailed and two-tailed.

::: fragment
Which will have the larger magnitude cutoff values?
:::

:::: {.columns .fragment style="font-size:70%"}
::: column
**One-Tailed**

All of our $\alpha = .05$ goes on the upper side

Need a cutoff for $.95$
```{r}
qt(p = .95, df = 3)

qt(p = .05, df = 37, lower.tail = F)
```
$t_{crit}(\text{df}=3) = 2.35$

$t_{crit}(\text{df}=37) = 1.69$
:::

::: column
**Two-Tailed**

$\alpha = 1 - .95 = 5\%$ on both sides

So $.05 / 2 = .025$ on each side

Need value for $.025$ and $.95 + .025$ ($[.025, .975]$)
```{r}
qt(p = c(.025, .975), df = 3)

qt(p = c(.025, .975), df = 37)
```
$t_{crit}(\text{df}=3) = [-3.18, 3.18]$

$t_{crit}(\text{df}=37) = [-2.03, 2.03]$

## Types of *T*-Tests

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20250128171318605791/Types-of-t-test.webp)


## Independent Sample *T*-Test

Might want to compare two samples of observations

[○ Post-graduation salaries of GT vs. UGA grads]{.subpoint}

[○ Treatment vs. control group]{.subpoint}

[○ Cats vs. dogs]{.subpoint}

We can represent each group with their mean on some outcome and compare the means

Consider whether the mean difference is significant but also have to account for different levels of variability within group


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: Pooled SD

Need to pool the sample SDs while noting different sample sizes

$$ s_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{(n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)} = \frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$$


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: Pooled SD

Note that when sample size is equal (i.e., $n_1 = n_2 = n$),

::: math
\begin{array}{ll}
  s_p^2 \bigg|_{n_1 = n_2 = n} & = \frac{(n - 1) s_1^2 + (n - 1) s_2^2}{(n - 1) + (n - 1)} = \frac{(n - 1) (s_1^2 + s_2^2)}{(n - 1) + (n - 1)} \\[0.6em]
   & = \frac{(n - 1) (s_1^2 + s_2^2)}{2(n - 1)} = \frac{s_1^2 + s_2^2}{2}
\end{array}
:::

::: fragment
Square root to get back to standard deviation

$$ s_p = \sqrt{s_p^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{(n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1) s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$
:::


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: Test statistic

$$ t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_p^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_p^2}{n_2}}} = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}$$

[Compare against critical *t*-value with df = $(n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 2)$]{.fragment}


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: R Calculation

```{r}
#| echo: false
candy <- rio::import(here::here("labs",
                                "Lab 11 - Independent and Paired Sample T-Test",
                                "candydata.csv"))
```

```{r}
summary(candy)

ccorn <- candy |> filter(candy == "candy corn") |> pluck("sales")
choc <- candy |> filter(candy == "chocolate") |> pluck("sales")
```
<br>
```{r}
ccorn
choc
```


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: R Calculation

::: fragment
```{r}
x_bar_ccorn <- mean(ccorn)
sd_ccorn <- sd(ccorn)
n_ccorn <- length(ccorn)

x_bar_choc <- mean(choc)
sd_choc <- sd(choc)
n_choc <- length(choc)

pooled_sd <- sqrt( ((n_ccorn - 1) * sd_ccorn^2 + (n_choc - 1) * sd_choc^2) /
                     ((n_ccorn - 1) + (n_choc - 1)) )
pooled_sd
```
:::

## Independent Sample *T*-Test: R Calculation

::: fragment
```{r}
df <- (n_ccorn - 1) + (n_choc - 1)

t_crit <- qt(c(.025, .975), df)
t_crit
```

If our observed *t*-statistic exceeds the bounds of [-2.02, 2.02], we reject the null.
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
t_stat <- (x_bar_ccorn - x_bar_choc) / (pooled_sd * sqrt(1 / n_ccorn + 1 / n_choc))
t_stat
```
:::

[We reject the null! Can we tell which had a larger mean?]{.fragment}


## Independent Sample *T*-Test: R Function

`t.test(outcome ~ group_var, data, var.equal = T)`

```{r}
t.test(sales ~ candy, candy, var.equal = T)
```


## Paired Sample *T*-Test

Comparing the same subjects under two conditions (typically two timepoints)

[○ Stress levels before vs. after a test]{.subpoint}

[○ Reaction times before vs. after caffiene consumption]{.subpoint}

[○ Anxiety levels before vs. after a mindfulness intervention]{.subpoint}

We can still use the mean to represent the observations in each condition and make comparisons

This time, focus on difference scores (individual differences in the observations between the two conditions)


## Paired Sample *T*-Test

Need difference score for each observation $d_i = x_2 - x_1$

Then, get mean difference $\bar{d} = \frac{d_1+d_2+...+d_n}{n}$ and standard deviation of those difference scores $s_d = \sqrt{\frac{(d_1-\bar{d})^2 + (d_2-\bar{d})^2 + ... + (d_n-\bar{d})^2}{n - 1}}$

$$ t = \frac{\bar{d} - \mu_{d_0}}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} = \text{(usually)} \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}} = \frac{\bar{d}}{\frac{s_d}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

Compare against critical *t*-value with df = $n - 1$


## Paired Sample *T*-Test: R Calculation

::: fragment
```{r}
#| include: false
pumpkins <- data.frame(pumpkin = 1:20,
           oct1 = rnorm(20, 12, 3)) |>
  mutate(oct31 = oct1 - rnorm(20, 3, 1),
         across(everything(), ~ round(.x, 2)))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
pumpkin <- rio::import(here::here("labs", "Lab 11 - Independent and Paired Sample T-Test", "pumpkindata.csv"))
```

```{r}
pumpkin <- pumpkin |>
  mutate(diff = Oct1 - Oct31)

mean_diff <- mean(pumpkin$diff)
sd_diff <- sd(pumpkin$diff)
df <- nrow(pumpkin) - 1

qt(c(.025, .975), df)

t_stat <- (mean_diff - 0) / (sd_diff / sqrt(nrow(pumpkin)))
t_stat
```
:::

[We can reject the null in favor of the alternative that there is a difference in pumpkin weights between October 1st and October 31st in the population!]{.fragment}


## Paired Sample *T*-Test: R Function

`t.test(y1_vector, y2_vector, paired = T, var.equal = T)`

```{r}
t.test(pumpkin$Oct1, pumpkin$Oct31, paired = T, var.equal = T)
```


## Cohen's *D* Revisited

Now that we have two groups, R functions for Cohen's *D* will be more helpful to us. The `cohens_d()` function from the `effectsize` package allows for many formats of inputs.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: false
(x_bar_ccorn - x_bar_choc) / pooled_sd

effectsize::cohens_d(sales ~ candy,
                     data = candy)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: false
mean_diff / sd_diff

effectsize::cohens_d(pumpkin$Oct1, pumpkin$Oct31,
                     paired = T)
```

## *T*-Test: Interpretation and write-up

An [independent samples / repeated measures] *t*-test analysis was conducted between [group 1] and [group 2]. We [[fail to reject]{.blue} / [reject]{.gold}] H0 [[in favor of H1]{.gold}], *t*([df]) = [____], *p* [[< 0.05]{.gold} / [p-value]{.blue}]. We [[did not]{.blue}] observe[[d]{.gold}] a significant difference between the mean [DV] of [group 1] and [group 2] in our sample.
